# School District Analysis

## Project Overview:
There was reason to beleive that the math and reading scores for the ninth graders at Thompson High School were tampered with. Those scores needed to be taken out and average Thompson High School scores were to be only counted for grades 10-12 for Thompson. Then repeat the school analysis, reporting how the metrics changed from the removal of grades of ninth graders from Thomas High School. 

## Results
* There were three small changes in the district summary. % Passing Math went up by .9%, % Passing Reading went up by 1% and % Overall Passing went up by .8%. So the change of taking out the ninth graders from THS( Thomas High School) changed the percents by increasing them by about 1%. 
* The changes in the school summary were very minor as well. The average reading score for THS went down by .5%. The average math score went up for THS by .05%. The percent of students passing math went down by .1%. The percent of passing reading went down by .3% while the overall passing percent went down by .3%. 
* Before the grades for the 9th graders for THS were taken out, THS was second when the top 5 schools were looked at. THS stayed in second place based on the % Overall Passing.
